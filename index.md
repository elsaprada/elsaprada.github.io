Hi! My name is **Elsa Prada** and I'm a **condensed matter theorist** working on systems where quantum phenomena play an important role, such as low dimensional materials and nanostructures.

Since July 2020 I belong to the [Materials Science Institute of Madrid](https://www.icmm.csic.es/) (which is part of the [Spanish Research Council](https://www.csic.es/)) as a tenured scientist. Within the department of Theory and Simulation of Materials, our group is called [Theory of Quantum Materials and Solid State Quantum Technologies](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/).
